# Overview

## Description

Mass spectrometry (MS) data is a key technology in modern proteomics and
metabolomics experiments. Due to continuous improvements in MS instrumentation,
the generated data can easily become very large. Also, additional resources of
MS data exist, such as spectra libraries and databases, all with their own
specific file formats and database systems that sometimes do not support
manipulations of the original data.

Learning from experiences with the `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` Bioconductor package,
the `r Biocpkg("Spectra")` package was developed to provide an even more
flexible and expandable infrastructure for MS data in R. This package implements
a clear separation between the user interface and the code to provide, store and
import MS data. The latter is defined by the `MsBackend` interface which thus
allows implementation of data type, format or storage-dependent
*backends*. Backends can thus be implemented for specific file types and data
resources or different ways to represent MS data (e.g. in memory or *on-disk*
data representations as described in [@gattoMSnbaseEfficientElegant2020a]). They
are also supposed to be interchangeable hence allowing the user to switch
backends without affecting the analysis. To enable processing of also very large
MS data sets, data manipulations are by default not directly applied to the data
but cached in a *lazy evaluation queue* which allows analyses also of
*read-only* data representations.

This (instructor-led live demo) workshop shows the expandability of the new
infrastructure to enable a seamless integration and analysis of MS data from a
variety of input formats illustrated by a simple comparison and matching of
experimental MS2 spectra against public spectral databases and export of the
data in a format commonly used for exchange of MS2 data.

# Workshop


## LC-MS/MS in a nutshell


- Mass spectrometry (**MS**) instruments measure mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) and
  abundances of ions. The resulting m/z and intensity values are
  stored/represented as a *spectrum*.
- Most compounds are not charged, they need to be ionized first (with
  e.g. electro spray ionization (**ESI**)).
- MS is usually combined with another separation technique, such as liquid
  chromatography (**LC**). This adds another dimension to the data: retention
  time (rt). For LC-MS data is represented by multiple spectra, each spectrum
  with its own retention time.


![*LC-MS setup*](LC-MS-drawing.gif)


- With LC-MS we measure *features* characterized by m/z and retention time - we
  still don't know what molecule was actually measured.
- Create in addition fragment (MS/MS) spectra from the ions to get some
  information about their structure.


![*CID-based fragmentation*](MSMS.png)


- Commonly used method: collision induced dissociation (**CID**). In a collision
  chamber filled with e.g. N2, ions get fragmented and a spectrum of these
  fragments is recorded.
- Comparing and matching such fragment spectra against a *reference* helps
  identifying the compound.



## The `Spectra` package

The `Spectra` package implements a clear separation between the user interface
and the code to provide, store and read mass spectrometry data. Thus, different
data or file format-specific *backends* can be implemented and directly
*plugged-in* without affecting the way the user would access or analyze the
data. This represents an extension to the *in-memory* and *on-disk* data modes
already available in the `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` package that enabled either a
fast data processing or an analysis of very large data sets by keeping only a
limited amount of data in the computer's memory
[@gattoMSnbaseEfficientElegant2020a].


![Spectra: separation into user functionality and data
representation](Spectra.png)


In this workshop we will:

- import MS data from *mzML* files,
- select MS2 spectra for a certain compound,
- compare and match the MS2 spectra against *reference* MS2 spectra from a
  public database,
- annotate the spectra and export them to a file in *MGF* format.


## MS data import and handling

Below we import the MS data from the mzML files provided within this
package. These files contain MSn data of a mix of 8 standard compounds (added
either to water or a pool of human serum samples) measured with a HILIC-based
LC-MS/MS setup. MS2 data was generated by data dependent acquisition using a
collision energy of 20eV. For data import and representation of these
experimental data we use the `MsBackendMzR` backend which supports import (and
export) of data from the most common *raw* mass spectrometry file formats
(i.e. mzML, mzXML and CDF).

```{r data-import, warning = FALSE}
library(Spectra)

#' Define the input files
fls <- dir(system.file("mzML", package = "SpectraTutorials"),
           full.names = TRUE)

#' Import the data
sps_all <- Spectra(fls, backend = MsBackendMzR())
```

The MS data is now represented by a `Spectra` object, which can be thought of as
a `data.frame` with rows being the individual spectra and columns the spectra
*variables* (such as `"rtime"`, i.e. the retention time). The `spectraVariables`
function lists all available variables within such a `Spectra` object.

```{r spectraVariables0}
#' List all available spectra variables (attributes)
spectraVariables(sps_all)
```

Each spectra variable can be accessed either *via* `$` and its name or by using
its dedicated access function (which is the preferred way). Below we access the
retention times of the first spectra using either `$rtime` or the function
`rtime`.

```{r rtime}
#' Access the spectras' retention time
head(sps_all$rtime)
head(rtime(sps_all))
```

Our `Spectra` object contains information from in total `r length(sps_all)`
spectra from `length(unique(dataOrigin(sps_all)))` mzML files. By using the
`MsBackendMzR` backend, only general information about each spectrum is kept in
memory resulting in a low memory footprint.

```{r on-disk-size}
print(object.size(sps_all), units = "MB")
```

The spectra's m/z and intensity values can be accessed with the `mz` or
`intensity` functions. By using an `MsBackendMzR` backend, these are retrieved
on demand from the original data files each time the functions are called.

```{r mz}
mz(sps_all)
```

We can also load the full data into memory by changing the backend from
`MsBackendMzR` to `MsBackendDataFrame`. This does not affect the way we use the
`Spectra` object itself: the same operations and functions are available,
independently of the way the data is stored (i.e. which backend is used).

```{r change-backend}
#' Change backend to a MsBackendDataFrame: load data into memory
sps_all <- setBackend(sps_all, MsBackendDataFrame())
```

The size of our `Spectra` object is now larger, since the full data has been
loaded into memory.

```{r in-mem-size}
print(object.size(sps_all), units = "MB")
```

To subset `Spectra` objects, we can use either `[` or one of the many available
`filter*` functions (that are usually more efficient than `[`). We could this
subset the `sps_all` to some arbitrary spectra simply using:

```{r subset}
sps_all[c(4, 2, 5)]
```

In our workshop, we next want to identify in our experimental data MS2 spectra
that were generated from an ion that matches the m/z of the `[M+H]+` ion of the
metabolite cystine (one of the standards added to the sample mix measured in the
present experimental data). We thus use below the `filterPrecursorMz` function
to subset the data to MS2 spectra matching that m/z (accepting a difference in
m/z of 10 parts-per-million (ppm)).

```{r filter-precursor-mz}
#' Define the m/z ratio for the [M+H]+ ion of cystine
mz <- 241.0311

#' Subset the dataset to MS2 spectra matching the m/z
sps <- filterPrecursorMz(sps_all, mz = mz + ppm(c(-mz, mz), 10))
sps
```

In total `r length(sps)` spectra matched our target precursor m/z.


## Data processing and manipulation

The `plotSpectra` function can be used to visualize spectra. Below we plot the
first spectrum from our data subset.

```{r raw-ms2, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
#' Plot the first spectrum
plotSpectra(sps[1])
```

This raw MS2 spectrum contains many very low intensity peaks, most likely
representing noise. Thus we next filter the spectra removing all peaks with an
intensity smaller than 5% of the maximum intensity of each spectrum (i.e. the
base peak intensity). To this end we define a function that takes intensity
values from each spectrum as input and returns a logical value whether the peak
should be retained (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`). This function is then passed to
the `filterIntensity` function to perform the actual filtering of the spectra.

```{r filter-intensity}
#' Define a filtering function
low_int <- function(x, ...) {
    x > max(x, na.rm = TRUE) * 0.05
}
#' Apply the function to filter the spectra
sps <- filterIntensity(sps, intensity = low_int)
```

After filtering, the spectra are *cleaner*:

```{r raw-ms2-filtered, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
#' Plot the first spectrum after filtering
plotSpectra(sps[1])
```

In addition we *normalize* each spectrum replacing the absolute intensity values
with values relative to the spectrum's maximum intensity (which is set to
100). Also for this operation we define a function which takes a *peak matrix*
as input and returns a matrix with the same dimensions. The peak matrix is the
two-column matrix with m/z (first column) and intensity values (second column)
representing the MS data of a spectrum. This function is then passed with
parameter `FUN` to the `addProcessing` function which allows to apply any
user-defined function to the peak matrix of each spectrum in a `Spectra`
object. With this function `Spectra` thus provides a powerful framework to apply
any user-defined data manipulation operation to MS data.

```{r normalize}
#' Define a function to *normalize* the intensities
norm_int <- function(x, ...) {
    maxint <- max(x[, "intensity"], na.rm = TRUE)
    x[, "intensity"] <- 100 * x[, "intensity"] / maxint
    x
}
#' *Apply* the function to the data
sps <- addProcessing(sps, norm_int)
```

To show the effect of the normalization we extract the intensities of the first
spectrum:

```{r}
#' Get the intensities after normalization
intensity(sps)[[1]]
```

The intensity values are now all between 0 and 100. Note however that all these
data manipulations (intensity filtering and normalization) did **not** change
the original m/z and intensity values in the `Spectra`. Data manipulation
operations are by default cached in the *lazy evaluation queue* of the `Spectra`
object and applied to the MS data *on-the-fly* each time m/z or intensity values
are accessed. This ensures that the same data manipulations can be applied to MS
data regardless of the used backend and hence the way the data is stored
(e.g. in *read-only* data resources such as raw MS data files or databases).

In addition, this mechanism enables to *undo* certain cached data manipulations
using the `reset` function:

```{r reset}
#' Remove any processing steps
sps_orig <- reset(sps)
head(intensity(sps_orig)[[1]])
```


## Spectrum data comparison

We next perform a pairwise comparison of the subsetted spectra using the dot
product as similarity measure. Prior to the actual similarity calculation, the
peaks of the individual spectra have to be matched against each other (i.e. it
has to be determined which peak from one spectrum correspond to which from the
other spectrum based on their mass-to-charge ratios). We specify `ppm = 20` so
that peaks with a difference in m/z smaller than 20ppm will be considered
matching.

```{r compare-spectra-self}
#' Pairwise comparison of all spectra
cormat <- compareSpectra(sps, ppm = 20)
cormat
```

The pairwise spectra similarities are represented with the heatmap below (note
that RStudio in the docker might crash by the `pheatmap` call - to avoid this
add `filename = "hm.pdf"` to the `heatmap` call).

```{r ms2-heatmap, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
library(pheatmap)
hm <- pheatmap(cormat, breaks = seq(0, 1, length.out = 101))
```

The similarity between all the selected experimental MS2 spectra is very high
(in fact above 0.88) suggesting all of them representing fragment spectra of the
same compound.


## Comparing spectra against MassBank

Although the precursor m/z of our spectra matches the m/z of cystine, we can
still not exclude that they represent fragmentations of ions from different
compounds (that would have the same precursor m/z than cystine).

Matching experimental spectra against a public spectral library can be used as a
first step in the identification process. Several (public) spectral libraries
for small molecules are available, such as:

- [MassBank](https://massbank.eu/MassBank/)
- MassBank of North America [MoNa](https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/)
- Human Metabolom Database [HMDB](https://hmdb.ca/)
- [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp)
- ...

For some of these databases `MsBackend` interfaces are already implemented
allowing inclusion of their data directly into R-based analysis
workflows. Access to MassBank data is for example possible with the `r
BiocStyle::Biocpkg("MsBackendMassbank")` package. This package provides the
`MsBackendMassbank` for import/export of
[MassBank files](https://github.com/MassBank/MassBank-data) as well as the
`MsBackendMassbankSql` backend that directly interfaces the MassBank MySQL
database.

Below we load the `MsBackendMassbank` package and connect to a local
installation of the MassBank MySQL database (release *2021.03* which is provided
within the docker image of this tutorial).

```{r massbank-library}
library(RMariaDB)
library(MsBackendMassbank)

#' Connect to the MassBank MySQL database
con <- dbConnect(MariaDB(), user = "massbank", dbname = "MassBank",
                 host = "localhost", pass = "massbank")
```

We can now initialize a `Spectra` object with a `MsBackendMassbankSql` backend
to access all the data in MassBank.

```{r massbank}
#' Access the spectra data in MassBank
mbank <- Spectra(con, source = MsBackendMassbankSql())
mbank
```

The `Spectra` object `mbank` *represents* now the MS data from the
MassBank database with in total `length(mbank)` spectra. In fact, the `mbank`
object itself does not contain any MS data, but only the primary keys of the
spectra in the MassBank database. Hence, it has also a relatively low memory
footprint.

```{r massbank-size}
print(object.size(mbank), units = "MB")
```

Any operation on a `Spectra` object with this backend will load the requested
data from the database on-the-fly. Calling `intensity` on such a `Spectra`
object would for example retrieve the intensity values for all spectra from the
database.

```{r massbank-intensity}
#' Get intensity values for the first spectrum
intensity(mbank[1])
```

As we can see, MassBank provides absolute intensities for each spectrum. We can
however *normalize* these with the same approach used above for the `Spectra`
object with the experimental data to result in intensity values between 0 and
100.

```{r massbank-normalize}
#' *Normalize* intensities for all MassBank spectra
mbank <- addProcessing(mbank, norm_int)
intensity(mbank[1])
```

This clearly illustrates the power of the `Spectra`'s *lazy evaluation queue*:
we can apply any data operation or manipulation without modifying the original
data.

We next aim at comparing our experimental spectra against the spectra from
MassBank. But instead of comparing against all `r length(mbank)` available
spectra, we first filter the MassBank database to spectra with a precursor m/z
matching the one of the *[M+H]+* ion of cystine. Note that, as an alternative to
the `filterPrecursorMz` used below, we could also use the `containsMz` function
to screen for spectra containing an actual peak matching the precursor m/z.

```{r massbank-precursor}
#' Filter MassBank for spectra of precursor ion
mbank_sub <- filterPrecursorMz(mbank, mz = mz + ppm(c(-mz, mz), 10))
mbank_sub
```

This left us with `r length(12)` spectra for which we calculate the similarity
against each of our experimental spectra using the `compareSpectra` function.

```{r massbank-compare-subset}
#' Compare MassBank subset to experimental spectra
res <- compareSpectra(mbank_sub, sps, ppm = 20)
res
```

As a result we got the (normalized dot product) similarity score between each
tested MassBank spectrum (rows) against each experimental spectrum (columns).

```{r}
pheatmap(res)
```

We get some very high similarity scores, but also some lower ones. We next
determine the best matching pair from all the comparisons.

```{r}
best_match <- which(res == max(res), arr.ind = TRUE)
best_match
```

The `best_match` variable contains now the index of the best matching MassBank
and experimental spectrum. Below we visualize these two using a *mirror plot*
showing in the upper panel the MS2 spectrum from MassBank and in the lower panel
the best matching experimental spectrum. Matching peaks are highlighted with a
blue color. Plotting functions in `Spectra` are highly customizable and in the
example below we add the m/z for each individual peak as an *annotation* to it
but only if the intensity of the peak is higher than 5.

```{r massbank-mirror-plot, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
#' Specifying a function to draw peak labels
label_fun <- function(x) {
    ints <- unlist(intensity(x))
    mzs <- format(unlist(mz(x)), digits = 4)
    mzs[ints < 5] <- ""
    mzs
}
plotSpectraMirror(mbank_sub[best_match[1]], sps[best_match[2]],
                  ppm = 20, labels = label_fun, labelPos = 2,
                  labelOffset = 0.2, labelSrt = -30)
grid()
```

As a comparison we plot also two spectra with a low similarity score.

```{r massbank-mirror-plot-low, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
plotSpectraMirror(mbank_sub[1], sps[3],
                  ppm = 20, labels = label_fun, labelPos = 2,
                  labelOffset = 0.2, labelSrt = -30)
grid()
```

Since we could identify a MassBank spectrum with a high similarity to our
experimental spectra we would also like to know which compound this spectrum
actually represents. `Spectra` objects are generally very flexible and can have
arbitrarily many additional annotation fields (i.e.  *spectra variables*) for
each spectrum. Thus, we below use the `spectraVariables` function to list all of
the variables that are available in our MassBank `Spectra` object.

```{r massbank-spectra-variables}
#' What variables are available in MassBank
spectraVariables(mbank_sub)
```

In fact, in addition to spectra specific information like the instrument on
which it was measured or the ionization voltage used, we get also information on
the originating compound such as its name (`"compound_name"`), its chemical
formula (`"formula"`) or its INChI key (`"inchikey"`). We thus next subset
`mbank_sub` to the best matching spectrum and display its associated compound
name.

```{r massbank-one-spectrum}
mbank_best_match <- mbank_sub[best_match[1]]
mbank_best_match$compound_name
```

Indeed, our experimental cystine spectrum matches (one) cystine spectrum in
MassBank. Below we next add the name and the chemical formula of this spectrum
to our experimental spectra. We also set the collision energy for to 20eV and
assign the ion/adduct of cystine from which the reference spectrum was created.

```{r}
#' Add annotations to the experimental spectra
sps$name <- mbank_best_match$compound_name
sps$formula <- mbank_best_match$formula
sps$adduct <- mbank_best_match$adduct
sps$collisionEnergy <- 20
```

Note: a more convenient spectra matching functionality designed for less
experienced R users is available in the
[`MetaboAnnotation`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/MetaboAnnotation)
package.


## Data export

At last we want to export our spectra to a file in MGF format. For this we use
the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("MsBackendMgf")` package which provides the
`MsBackendMgf` backend that adds support for MGF file import/export to `Spectra`
objects.

Data from `Spectra` objects can generally be exported with the `export`
function. The format in which the data is exported depends on the specified
`MsBackend` class. By using an instance of `MsBackendMgf` we define to export
the data to a file in MGF format.

```{r export}
library(MsBackendMgf)

#' Export the spectra to a MGF file
export(sps, backend = MsBackendMgf(), file = "Cystine_ce20.mgf")
```


## Comparing spectra against HMDB

In addition to the `MsBackendMassbank`, which provides access to MassBank data,
there is also the
[`MsBackendHmdb`](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/MsBackendHmdb) package
supporting spectral data from the public Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). This
package does however not yet provide direct access to the HMDB database but,
through the `MsBackendHmdbXml` backend, allows to import MS2 spectra files in
HMDB format. These are provided by HMDB as individual xml files in a custom file
format which are bundled (and can hence be downloaded) in a single archive.

To reproduce the following code it is expected (as detailed in the Installation
section) that all xml files from HMDB are available in a folder
*data/hmdb_all_spectra*. Below we identify all xml files containing the key word
`"ms_ms"` in their file name and load them into a `Spectra` object using the
`MsBackendHmdbXml` backend. Note that this import operation from the ~ 500,000
individual xml files takes up to ~ 2 hours to finish.

```{r hmdb-import, eval = FALSE}
library(MsBackendHmdb)

#' Get all MS2 spectra xml files and import data
fls <- dir("data/hmdb_all_spectra/", full.names = TRUE, pattern = "ms_ms")
hmdb <- Spectra(fls, source = MsBackendHmdbXml(), nonStop = TRUE)
```

```{r hmdb-import-save, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#' Eventually save for faster re-use
save(hmdb, file = "data/hmdb.RData", compress = "xz")
```

```{r hmdb-load, echo = FALSE}
#' Load the pre-generated Spectra object with spectra from HMDB.
library(MsBackendHmdb)
data("hmdb", package = "SpectraTutorials")
```

With this we have now a `Spectra` object containing all MS2 spectra from
HMDB. Note that with the `MsBackendHmdbXml` all spectra data is kept in memory.

```{r}
hmdb
```

Also here, we want to filter the data resource first for spectra with a matching
precursor m/z. Unfortunately, HMDB does not provided the spectra's precursor m/z
and we hence need to used the `containsMz` function to find spectra containing a
peak with an m/z matching the m/z of our ion of interest. In addition, We need
to use a rather large `tolerance` value (which defines the maximal acceptable
absolute difference in m/z values) since some of the experimental spectra in
HMDB seem to be recorded by not well calibrated instrument.

```{r has-mz}
#' Identify spectra containing a peak matching cystine m/z
has_mz <- containsMz(hmdb, mz = mz, tolerance = 0.2)
```

In total `r sum(has_mz)` spectra contain a peak with the required m/z (+/- 0.2
Dalton) and we can proceed to calculate spectral similarities between these and
our experimental spectra.

```{r compare-subset}
#' Subset HMDB
hmdb_sub <- hmdb[has_mz]

#' Compare HMDB against experimental spectra
res <- compareSpectra(hmdb_sub, sps, tolerance = 0.2)
```

The highest similarity between our spectra and the spectra from HMDB is `r
max(res)`. Below we compare the two best matching spectra with a *mirror plot*,
in the upper panel showing our experimental spectrum and in the lower panel the
best matching MS2 spectrum from HMDB.

```{r mirror-plot, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
best_match <- which(res == max(res), arr.ind = TRUE)
## Specifying a function to draw peak labels
label_fun <- function(x) {
    format(unlist(mz(x)), digits = 4)

Our experimental spectrum seems to nicely match the *reference* MS2 in
HMDB. Below we extract the compound identifier from the best matching HMDB
spectrum (stored in a spectra variable called `"compound_id"`)

```{r}
hmdb_sub[best_match[1]]$compound_id
```

In fact, the matching spectrum from HMDB is an experimental spectrum for
[L-Cystine](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0000192).


# Summary

With the simple use case of matching experimental MS2 spectra against a public
database we illustrated in this short tutorial the flexibility and expandability
of the `Spectra` package that enables the seamless integration of mass
spectrometry data from different sources. This was only possible with a clear
separation of the user functionality (`Spectra` object) from the representation
of the data (`MsBackend` object). Backends such as the
[`MsBackendMgf`](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/MsBackendMgf), the
[`MsBackendMassbank`](https://github.com/michealwitting/MsBackendMassbank) or
the [`MsBackendHmdbXml`](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/MsBackendHmdb)
provide support for additional data formats or data sources, while others,
due to their much lower memory footprint (`MsBackendMzR`, `MsBackendHdf5Peaks`),
enable the analysis of also very large data sets. Most importantly however,
these backends are interchangeable and do not affect the way users can handle
and analyze MS data with the `Spectra` package.


# What else?

- [`MetaboAnnotation`](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MetaboAnnotation)
  (Andrea Vicini, Michael Witting) to provide simple functions for matching of
  spectra or m/z and retention time data.
- [`CompoundDb`](https://github.com/EuracBiomedicalResearch/CompoundDb) to
  create and use small compound annotation databases (including `Spectra`).
- [`MsExperiment`](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsExperiment) to
  represent whole MS experiments (incl. `Spectra`, sample annotation, data
  quantitation, annotation files etc).
- [`msQC`](https://github.com/tnaake/msQC) (Thomas Naake): QC measures for MS
  data.
- [`MsBackendMsp`](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendMsp)
  (Steffen Neumann): backend for files in MSP format.
- [`MsBackendSql`](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/MsBackendSql) (Chong
  Tang): SQL-based backend for very large data sets.
