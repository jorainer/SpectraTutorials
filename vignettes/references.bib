  abstract = {We present version 2 of the MSnbase R/Bioconductor package. MSnbase provides infrastructure for the manipulation, processing, and visualization of mass spectrometry data. We focus on the new on-disk infrastructure, that allows the handling of large raw mass spectrometry experiments on commodity hardware and illustrate how the package is used for elegant data processing, method development, and visualization.},

	abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry is an important tool for structure elucidation of natural and synthetic organic products. Fragmentation of odd electron ions (OE⁺) generated by electron ionization (EI) was extensively studied in the last few decades, however there are only a few systematic reviews available concerning the fragmentation of even-electron ions (EE⁺/EE-) produced by the currently most common ionization techniques, electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). This review summarizes the most important features of tandem mass spectra generated by collision-induced dissociation fragmentation and presents didactic examples for the unexperienced users.},
