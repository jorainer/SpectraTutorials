  abstract = {We present version 2 of the MSnbase R/Bioconductor package. MSnbase provides infrastructure for the manipulation, processing, and visualization of mass spectrometry data. We focus on the new on-disk infrastructure, that allows the handling of large raw mass spectrometry experiments on commodity hardware and illustrate how the package is used for elegant data processing, method development, and visualization.},
